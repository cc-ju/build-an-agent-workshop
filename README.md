# Build an Agent in <10 Minutes!

> You probably want to run this in a sandbox. ☝️

## Pre-Requesites

1. Any agent with access to a Claude model (even Haiku works)
2. An Antropic API key
3. go is installed or you are fine with the agent installing it (it will probably try to)

## How?

1. `export MY_AGENT_API_KEY=<your api key>`
2. Open your favorite agent and tell it: `@PROMPT.md`. Use `--yolo`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or whatever your tool uses if you want to see the agent rip 🚀
3. Play around!
